## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

Accurate free-energy estimation is essential in molecular simulation, yet the
periodic boundary conditions (PBC) commonly used in computer simulations have
rarely been explicitly exploited. Equilibrium methods such as umbrella
sampling, metadynamics, and adaptive biasing force require extensive sampling,
while non-equilibrium pulling with Jarzynski's equality suffers from poor
convergence due to exponential averaging. Here, we introduce a
physics-informed, score-based diffusion framework: by map...
