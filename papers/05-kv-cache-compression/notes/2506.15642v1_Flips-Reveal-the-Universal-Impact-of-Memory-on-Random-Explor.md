## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

Quantifying space exploration is a central question in random walk theory,
with direct applications ranging from animal foraging, diffusion-limited
reactions, and intracellular transport to stock markets. In particular, the
explored domain by one or many simple memoryless (or Markovian) random walks
has received considerable attention . However, the physical systems mentioned
above typically involve significant memory effects, and so far, no general
framework exists to analyze such systems. We i...
