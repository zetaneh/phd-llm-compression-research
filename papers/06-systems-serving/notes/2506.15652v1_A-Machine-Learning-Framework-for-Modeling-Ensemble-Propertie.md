## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

Disorder, though naturally present in experimental samples and strongly
influencing a wide range of material phenomena, remains underexplored in
first-principles studies due to the computational cost of sampling the large
supercell and configurational space. The recent development of machine learning
techniques, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), has enabled the
efficient and accurate predictions of complex material properties, offering
promising tools for studying disordered systems. In...
