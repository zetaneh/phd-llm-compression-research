## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

We report the discovery of an unusual z=1.14 object, dubbed the $\infty$
galaxy, in JWST imaging of the COSMOS field. Its rest-frame near-IR light is
dominated by two compact nuclei with stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}$ Msun and
a projected separation of 10 kpc. Both nuclei have a prominent ring or shell
around them, giving the galaxy the appearance of a figure eight or an $\infty$
symbol. The morphology resembles that of the nearby system II Hz 4, where the
head-on collision of two galaxies wit...
