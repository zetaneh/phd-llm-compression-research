## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

The z=1.14 $\infty$ galaxy consists of two ringed nuclei with an active
supermassive black hole (SMBH) in between them. The system is likely the result
of a nearly face-on collision between two disk galaxies with massive bulges. In
van Dokkum et al. (2025) we suggested that the SMBH may have formed from
shocked and compressed gas at the collision site, in a runaway gravitational
collapse. Here we test this hypothesis using newly obtained NIRSpec IFU
observations. We first confirm that the system...
