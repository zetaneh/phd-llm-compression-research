## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

Under unitary evolution, a typical macroscopic quantum system is thought to
develop wavefunction branches: a time-dependent decomposition into orthogonal
components that (1) form a tree structure forward in time, (2) are approximate
eigenstates of quasiclassical macroscopic observables, and (3) exhibit
effective collapse of feasibly measurable observables. If they could be defined
precisely, wavefunction branches would extend the theory of decoherence beyond
the system-environment paradigm and c...
