## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

Understanding the properties of biological systems is an exciting avenue for
applying advanced approaches to solving corresponding computational tasks. A
specific class of problems that arises in the resolution of biological
challenges is optimization. In this work, we present the results of a
proof-of-concept study that applies a quantum-inspired optimization algorithm
to simulate a viral response. We formulate an Ising-type model to describe the
patterns of gene activity in host responses. Red...
