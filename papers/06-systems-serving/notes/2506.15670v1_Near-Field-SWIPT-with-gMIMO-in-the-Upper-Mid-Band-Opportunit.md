## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

This paper explores the integration of simultaneous wireless information and
power transfer (SWIPT) with gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (gMIMO)
technology operating in the upper mid-band frequency range (7-24 GHz). The
near-field propagation achieved by gMIMO introduces unique opportunities for
energy-efficient, high-capacity communication systems that cater to the demands
of 6G wireless networks. Exploiting spherical wave propagation, near-field
SWIPT with gMIMO enables precise energy ...
