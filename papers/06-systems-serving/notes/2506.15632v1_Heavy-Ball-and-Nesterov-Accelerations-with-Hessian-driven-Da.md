## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

In this work, we investigate a second-order dynamical system with
Hessian-driven damping tailored for a class of nonconvex functions called
strongly quasiconvex. Buil\-ding upon this continuous-time model, we derive two
discrete-time gra\-dient-based algorithms through time discretizations. The
first is a Heavy Ball method with Hessian correction, incorporating
cur\-va\-tu\-re-dependent terms that arise from discretizing the Hessian
damping component. The second is a Nesterov-type accelerated me...
