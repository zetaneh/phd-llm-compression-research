## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

Dataflow neural network accelerators efficiently process AI tasks on FPGAs,
with deployment simplified by ready-to-use frameworks and pre-trained models.
However, this convenience makes them vulnerable to malicious actors seeking to
reverse engineer valuable Intellectual Property (IP) through Side-Channel
Attacks (SCA). This paper proposes a methodology to recover the hardware
configuration of dataflow accelerators generated with the FINN framework.
Through unsupervised dimensionality reduction,...
