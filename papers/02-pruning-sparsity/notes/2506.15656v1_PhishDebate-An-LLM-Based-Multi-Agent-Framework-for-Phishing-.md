## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

Phishing websites continue to pose a significant cybersecurity threat, often
leveraging deceptive structures, brand impersonation, and social engineering
tactics to evade detection. While recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) have enabled improved phishing detection through contextual
understanding, most existing approaches rely on single-agent classification
facing the risks of hallucination and lack interpretability or robustness. To
address these limitations, we propose PhishDebate,...
