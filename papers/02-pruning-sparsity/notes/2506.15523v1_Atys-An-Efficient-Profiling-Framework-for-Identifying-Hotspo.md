## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

To handle the high volume of requests, large-scale services are comprised of
thousands of instances deployed in clouds. These services utilize diverse
programming languages and are distributed across various nodes as encapsulated
containers. Given their vast scale, even minor performance enhancements can
lead to significant cost reductions. In this paper, we introduce Atys1, an
efficient profiling framework specifically designed to identify hotspot
functions within large-scale distributed servic...
