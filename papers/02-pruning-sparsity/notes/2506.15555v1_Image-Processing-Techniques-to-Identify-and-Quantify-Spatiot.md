## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide due to human activities through fossil fuel
emissions and land use changes have increased climate extremes such as heat
waves and droughts that have led to and are expected to increase the occurrence
of carbon cycle extremes. Carbon cycle extremes represent large anomalies in
the carbon cycle that are associated with gains or losses in carbon uptake.
Carbon cycle extremes could be continuous in space and time and cross political
boundaries. Here, we present a me...
