## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

When two successive squeezing operations with the same phase are applied to a
field mode, reliably estimating the amplitude of each is impossible because the
output state depends solely on their sum. In this case, the quantum statistical
model becomes sloppy, and the quantum Fisher information matrix turns singular.
However, estimation of both parameters becomes feasible if the quantum state is
subjected to an appropriate scrambling operation between the two squeezing
operations. In this work, w...
