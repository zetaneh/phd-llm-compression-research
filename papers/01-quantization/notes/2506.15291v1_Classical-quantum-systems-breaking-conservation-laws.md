## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

Whether gravity must be quantized remains one of the biggest open problems in
fundamental physics. Classical-quantum hybrid theories have recently attracted
attention as a possible framework in which gravity is treated classically yet
interacts consistently with quantum matter. Schemes based on completely
positive dynamics satisfy most formal consistency requirements and enable a
systematic treatment of quantum backreaction, but they also give rise to
features that challenge conventional physica...
