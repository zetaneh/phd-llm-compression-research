## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

Randomness extractors are algorithms that distill weak random sources into
near-perfect random numbers. Two-source extractors enable this distillation
process by combining two independent weak random sources. Raz's extractor (STOC
'05) was the first to achieve this in a setting where one source has linear
min-entropy (i.e., proportional to its length), while the other has only
logarithmic min-entropy in its length. However, Raz's original construction is
impractical due to a polynomial computati...
