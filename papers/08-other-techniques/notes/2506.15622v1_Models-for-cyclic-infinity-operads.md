## 📋 Summary (3-5 sentences)

We construct model structures on cyclic dendroidal sets and cyclic dendroidal
spaces for cyclic quasi-operads and complete cyclic dendroidal Segal spaces,
respectively. We show these models are Quillen equivalent to the model
structure for simplicial cyclic operads. This answers in the affirmative a
question of the second author and Drummond-Cole concerning model structures for
cyclic $\infty$-operads. We infer similar statements for planar cyclic
$\infty$-operads, providing the model-categorica...
